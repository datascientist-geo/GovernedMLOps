### Package Governance

Package governance is key in an enterprise environment in controlling access and security of modules and packages that are needed for model development and deployment.

For the rest of the tutorial, we will utilize a predefined custom environment when running selected notebooks. The custom environment has selected packages pre-installed so users can simly `import` them when needed, without having to worry about the logistics of install the packages themselves.

To use the custom environment for running a notebook, select the `GovMLOps-Env` in the `Select runtime` dropdown when creating a new notebook in your project. If you do not see see this custom environment, the project owner or admin can followthe instructions [here](./Package-Governance-Custom-Env-Setup.ipynb)
